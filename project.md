## Overview
  
The goal of this final project is to merge what you have learned from statistical
programming and create something useful for another researcher or future student to use. 

It is very important in the world of Big Data and Computing that we learn how to present and display material for audiences with diverse backgrounds to enage in. We need to take the code and the skills we have and put them to use for an audience that does not have the same skills. 

## Project Guidelines

### Individual Aspect

1. Go to the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) website.
    - Explore the [gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of Project ideas. 
    - Follow the [Tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)
    - Go through this [Walkthrough by Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/)
    - To show you have done this, create a simple app that takes a standard normal statistic and displays the probability of achieving that value or greater in a standard normal distribution. In other words it takes a \(z\) value and gives a p-value. 

    
### Group Aspect

2. As a group your first task will be to come up with an idea for a Shiny app and to write the code for this. In order to facilitate this more I will provide some structure. 
    - Your app must allow a researcher to use their own inputs. 
    - Your app must display some type of interactive user interface aspects. 
        - For example - [Normal Calculator](https://www.sullivanstatistics.com/shiny/normcalc/): In this app I created depending on where the researcher wants to shade the normal distribution different boxes will pop up after the researcher makes a choice. 
    - You app must display graphical as well as statistical output. 
    - Your app must not be created copying code from an example app that is out there.
        - We want to make sure you are not plagerizing. In the Normal Calculator app I provided, it appears similar to the DistCalc app from the shiny gallery, however the code behind it comes from my own code and graphing work that I have done in the past. None was copied or pasted from another Shiny app.
    - Your app must function properly and be useful. 
    - Your app must run quickly and not be bulky.
    - Your app should be easy to use or contain detailed instructions.
3. Go through all of the [past Shiny Apps created in PHP 2560](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects)
    - Go into the code and download all of the necessary packages to make them run. 
    - Run them using the commands in the README.md file of the repository. 
    - Write a one paragraph critique of the app.
        - Was it easy to use?
        - Was it fast to use?
        - How was the look and feel of it. 

## Dates of Importance



1. 04/17/2016 
    - During this week you will be learning how to write a shiny app.
    - Your calculator must be in a single file format.
    - Must be done individually.
    - Turn in Critiques of other groups work (group assignment)
2. 04/24/2017 
    - Form a group of 3-4 people and have an idea of what kind of app you want to create by this date.  
    - Provide me with an explanation of:
    - What your app will do?
    - How do you see it being used?
    - What types of options might you try to included for the user.
    - If you are struggling with ideas [check this out](/ideas)
    - [Project Starter Code](https://classroom.github.com/group-assignment-invitations/b77f48fc4b1da879109937becd702531)
3. 05/02/2017-05/03/2017 
    - We will spend 2 classes this week working on your app
    - Bring a rough copy of your app to class.
    - We will critique apps as a class.
4. 05/09/2017
    - We will take this last class to explore the apps together.
    - Each group will briefly discuss their app and show how to use it.
    - Presentations must be concise and display usage of the app.
5. 05/16/2017 
    - Final App due to me.
    - You must have your final app in either a 1 or 2 file format.
    - Provide an explanation of how it is to be used and discussing the creation of it.
    - Detail the parts of the app you did individually.
    - Submit form on grading your group members work and contribution to the project.
