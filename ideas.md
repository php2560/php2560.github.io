It can be difficult to come up with original ideas for apps. You might want to try these things

1. Consider a Hobby and how you could create an app around it. Examples:
    a. [Health and Fitness](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/02_Health_Fitness)
    b. [Draft Kings](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/01_Draft_Kings)
2. Consider some work your are currently doing in school and create an app around that. Examples
    a. [Migration](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/04_Migration)
    b. [Emulator](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/06_Emulator)
    c. [Associations](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/05_Associations)
3. Consider an App you might find that would help people with something. Examples:
    a. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/04_Linear_Regression)
    b. [Flight Information](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/06_Flight_Info)
    c. [Libraries](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/01_Libraries)
4. Consider an app that might revolve around current events of politics. Examples:
    a. [Twitter Sentiment](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/05_Twitter_Sentiment)
    b. [Counties](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/03_Counties)
5. Consider an app from the shiny directory and try to build upon or expand this in your own unique way. ***Note in this method you cannot just copy the code from the shiny page.***
