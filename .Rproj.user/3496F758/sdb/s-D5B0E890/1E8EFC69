It is my hope that these resources will help you to either use R or expand your knowledge of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for fisheries-related analyses.  Take a look around!!\n\n[R is an environment](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical analyses and graphics that is rapidly gaining popularity with fisheries scientists.  See [Inside-R](http://www.inside-r.org/what-is-r) and [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for two descriptions of R.\n\n<div style=\"width=auto; max-width:450px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;text-align:center\">\n  <img src=\"img/fishRlogoTight.jpg\" alt=\"fishR logo\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n",
